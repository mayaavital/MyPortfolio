          <h2>Background & Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Plated was a group project for my course on human computer
            interaction design. We were tasked to pick a domain and follow the 5
            stage design process. In my role I oversaw and participated in every
            step of the design and development, from organizing team materials
            to helping implement databases and implementing the mobile
            interface, I made significant contributions to our final product and
            process.

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            During our needfinding process we explored the domain of cooking and
            found that many amateur chefs find cooking to be a tedious chore
            that often takes longer than expected and lacks creativity.<br /><br />
            Plated addresses this by offering a curated selection of user-shared
            recipes tailored to individual preferences and available
            ingredients. Additionally, the app features an in-app virtual chef
            assistant, Chef Su, who provides guidance and answers common cooking
            questions. By fostering creativity and collaboration, Plated
            transforms cooking into a more enjoyable and accessible experience
            for chefs of all skill levels.<br /><br />
            Through needfinding interviews with diverse participants, we
            explored the challenges and motivations of amateur cooks to uncover
            key insights that inform the design of effective cooking solutions.
            Out of 4 hour long interviews in the span of a week, distinct
            patterns and needs emerged. Chef N emphasized the importance of
            accessible, flexible recipes that spark curiosity and allow cooking
            to become a form of self-expression. Travis highlighted the need for
            meal preparation to align with specific nutritional goals while
            being time-efficient and less of a chore. The Philz Customer shared
            the challenge of cooking as an unenjoyable task and stressed the
            importance of creating quick, easy meals that satisfy her family.
            These insights underscored that time, knowledge gaps, and motivation
            are significant barriers for amateur cooks, and solutions that
            simplify cooking while fostering creativity and enjoyment could be
            transformative.
          </p>
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            After creating our interview protocol, we recruited interview
            participants. Most of them were randomly approached, only one was
            recruited for their expertise in the cooking and cooking education
            domain. After conducting several interviews, we frameworked the data
            in an empathy map in order to make sense of it.<br /><br />
            With the data from our interview analysis, we created POV statements
            for our most engaging interviews (Jad, Philz customer, and Travis),
            while also keeping in mind diversity of thought and background.
            After we created each POV, we rapidly brainstormed 35 HMW statements
            for Jad, Philz customer, and Travis each. We boiled down the 35 HMW
            per interviewee to the 2-3 most interesting, and from there
            brainstormed solutions. We came away with three viable solutions:
            Dinner Party Planning App, Food tinder, and Su chef.

            Our final solution, Plated, focuses on enhancing the cooking
            experience for amateur chefs by offering a curated selection of
            recipes based on their pantry items and preferences. The app
            empowers users to discover new recipes, manage their ingredient
            inventory, and even contribute their own creations, fostering
            creativity and independence in the kitchen. This solution reflects
            our mission to make cooking both enjoyable and accessible,
            addressing user frustrations with uninspiring meal preparation.<br /><br />
            First we built a low fidelity prototype by sketching about 21
            screens that covered the functionality of our app across different
            task flows. We conducted usability testing on four potential users
            from different demographics and with different backgrounds. With our
            results we went onto building our medium fidelity prototype in
            Figma, receiving design feedback from HCI Phd students halfway
            through the development. Before implementing our prototype in react
            native, our figma prototype underwent heuristic evaluation process.
            After fixing our heuristic violations, we began developing our
            high-fi prototype through React Native and included almost every
            feature we initially set out to develop. Here's the evolution of
            Plated

            <div class="carousel-slide">
              <img src="images/filters.jpg" alt="Filters" />
            </div>
            <button class="carousel-arrow right" aria-label="Next slide">

            </button>
            <div class="carousel-thumbnails">

              <img src="images/home.jpg" alt="Home" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            <br />
            During the development process I performed overall polishing of the
            entire app along with implementing multiple features myself. First I
            did the chef su chat bot integration, I used a Gemini API to
            accomplish this and kept our interface simple but on brand. To
            facilitate easy use, I included potential chat prompts and an
            informational page with more details about how to use our chat bot,
            along with disclosures about the Gemini API. <br /><br />

            Additionally I implemented the user profile page, this page is
            designed to be the hub for recipe access with options to organize
            all recipes into "cookbooks", along with sections displaying your
            personal, saved, and recreation recipes. I used Supabase Java based
            Client library commands to render recipes from our database
            belonging in each category in their recipe boxes, along with the
            corresponding recipe data on each recipe details page. You can see
            the final product of my work in our demo video below!

            All this work culminated in our final project expo where we were
            able to speak about our product to the project judges, other
            students, interested faculty, and industry folks. This served as an
            opportunity to practice speaking about our product in a way that
            translates our vision to potential users, while also allowing us to
            get authentic feedback for us to use with any future work on this
            project. During this expo we ran demos of the application and
            allowed users to post "recipes" in real time. If you would like to
