          <h2>Background & Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Synth was a 10-week-long project for my course CS 377U:
            Understanding Users with
            <a href="https://www.frankbentley.com/" target="_blank"
              >Frank Bentley</a
            >. It required us to work on a team and apply our course learnings
            on industry user research and design methods to the execution of a
            project. <br /><br />In my role, I oversaw and contributed to every
            stage of the process, from a literature review and generative study
            to usability testing with an MVP and a field study with a fully
            functional demo app.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            We set out to design an application that addressed key themes and
            pain points uncovered in our preliminary research: the value of
            music as a social connector, the importance of in-person sharing,
            and the mixed effectiveness of traditional gamification methods.
            Specifically, we aimed to explore how a game-based experience could
            foster deeper group identity, increase music discovery diversity,
            and create more meaningful, socially motivated interactions.
            <br /><br />
            Our goal was to build an engaging, multiplayer application that
            leveraged these insights to enhance the way people share and
            discover music together.
          </p>
          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Our process can be seperated into three phases: <br />
            1. An initial literature review, market analysis, and generative
            research study <br />
            2. An iterative design and development process with usability
            testing guiding our desgin decisions <br />
            3. The field study with our fully functional demo app <br />
            <br />
            Our <strong>literature review & competitive review</strong> allowed
            us to first understand what others have done in the domain of music
            sharing and discovery, while also identifying gaps in the literature
            and app market. With this knowledge, we defined
            <strong
              >open research questions that we focused on in our generative
              research study</strong
            >:
          </p>

          <ul class="question-list">
            <li>
              Can gamification be leveraged to improve music discovery diversity
              and encourage exploration?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are meaningful and motivational incentives to use when
              gamifying the exploration of music?
            </li>
            <li>
              What specific combination of these factors can maximize user
              engagement & satisfaction?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our <strong>generative study</strong> consisted of three one-on-one
            in-depth interviews and a diary study where three participants used
            the music-sharing platform Airbuds and shared their experience.
            After aggregating the feedback we received in our generative study,
            we established the following <strong>key themes</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul class="question-list">
            <li>
              People have meaningful reactions to the music that people listen
              to.
            </li>
            <li>Sharing music is an important feature in music discovery.</li>
            <li>
              In-person music sharing adds value and depth to the kinds of
              interactions that can be had.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants like social games but there's mixed sentiment around
              other forms of gamification such as badges, streaks, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The above feedback guided our decision to design our app to be a
            social, music-sharing game that people would play in person to
            facilitate meaningful interactions. Enter <strong>Synth</strong>, a
            social music-based game that combines Spotify integration with
            interactive, multiplayer gameplay to facilitate music discovery and
            competition with your friends.<br /><br />
            Players each contribute five recently played Spotify tracks, which
            are pooled and randomly selected to create a unique song for each
            round. In every round, a 30-second clip is played, and players must
            guess who listened to the song, earning points for correct guesses
            and optionally opening the track to save on Spotify. <br /><br />As
            we designed and implemented our product, we performed
            <strong>usability tests</strong> at each phase of development
            (sketches, Figma, and MVP) using the feedback to address key
            problems on a feature-level, design/prompt-level, or overall product
            strategy decisions.

            Our final app in its entirety is hosted on Vercel as a web
            application, and we were able to start our
            <strong>field study</strong>. We utilized multiple methods again,
            <strong
              >informational interviews, playtests, and diary studies</strong
            >. We tested with our target audience, college freshmen, who are
            often in a phase of expressed desire to meet new people and deepen
            their social connections. <br /><br />
            In the front half of the field study, we ran playtests where we
            would observe gameplay amongst a group of 3-8 players, taking notes
            and doing informational interviews after. Then we chose a group of 4
            friends to do a diary study with the app over a week to understand
            how our application is used in people's daily lives. Collecting
            quantitative data with Firebase Analytics and qualitative data
            across all of our methods, we were able to explore the larger story
            of synth and formulate design implications that should be addressed
            in the future.
          </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            All this work culminated in our final presentation on our full
            product journey in front of highly regarded industry experts and a
            final CHI style research paper. In our presentation we got the
            opportunity to practice speaking about our product and process
            similar to how a product team might present their work. Our judges
            asked us questions about our process and our product.
            <br />
            I have included our final paper below and presentation which
            contains a quick demo.
