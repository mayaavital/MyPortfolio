          <p>
            Failure is inevitable in a sport like water polo, but what you learn
            from the failure is the key to helping you succeed the next time.
            The design world moves fast and fails often, failure is an essential
            part of exploration and creativity. I am confident that my
            resilience will drive me to continue learning from failures and move
            towards a successful outcome. <br />

          <p>
            The schedule of a student athlete in computer science and symbolic
            systems is demanding. At a minimum I devote 20 hours a week to water
            polo. I quickly had to learn how to put my head down and work,
            getting the most out of every hour. I strongly believe that this
            ability will make me very efficient in a work place environment.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Teamwork</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            No one can win alone in water polo, it requires a tight knit group
            who can always show up for eachother and work to make eachother
            better, on a true team every member has a valued role that advances
            the team's goal. SWE & design roles are extremely collaborative, as
            a life long team sport athlete I thrive in these kinds of
            environment.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Goalie is a unique position in water polo, it requires you to build
            a strong leadership presence from a young age. Throughout my career
            I've observed and learned from many different leadership styles
            while simultaneously cultivating my own in the cage. In a work
            setting, I believe my hands on experiences whether it's from being a
            team captain to a freshman 2nd string goalie will allow me to be
            both a leader and a learner on the job.
