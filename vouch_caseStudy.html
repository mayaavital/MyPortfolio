          <h2>Background & Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Vouch was a 6-week project for my course, CS 278: Social Computing.
            We worked in teams to design, launch, and manage a novel social
            computing system. We then analyzed the behavior we saw on our system
            through the lens of social computing system theories and ideas we
            learned throughout the course.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            We set out to solve the problem of how to make online dating less
            stressful, more authentic, and socially engaging by shifting the
            responsibility of matchmaking from individuals to their trusted
            friend groups. <br /><br />
            Traditional dating apps often place pressure on users to make the
            first move and present themselves perfectly, which can be
            intimidating, especially in close-knit communities like Stanford. By
            leveraging strong social ties and group participation, our goal was
            to create a dating experience that felt more collaborative,
            inclusive, and fun, while addressing key pain points around
            self-presentation, engagement, and user retention.
          </p>
          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            First, we drew on course concepts to choose a project topic to
            explore with our new sociotechnical system, we chose the frictions
            and social dynamics that exist among users on app-based dating
            sites. The main sticking points we are referring to are:
          </p>
          <ul class="question-list">
            <li>
              That having so many options at your fingertips can make dating
              apps feel more like an extrinsic game rather than a pursuit of an
              intrinsic human connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result of this mechanism, matches begin to pile up without
              either user feeling inclined to escalate this match into a real
              date.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To mitigate this dead end in the dating app paradigm, we wanted to
            create a sociotechnical system that would prioritize in-person
            connections and getting users on first dates. In order to test our
            envisioned core social dynamics without having to build any complex
            code, we performed a piggyback experience prototype. When building a
            sociotechnical system, the most important question is less about
            whether the interface is usable and more about nailing how the
            social dynamics will play out.
          </p>
          <h4>Piggyback Prototype</h4>
          <p>
            For our prototype, we acted as the matching algorithm, finding
            people in our community who we knew to be single, and leveraged
            iMessage to gauge each pair's availability, activity level, and
            price range for the activity that we would then choose for them.
            After the date ended, we interviewed each person to get their
            thoughts and feelings on the whole process. <br /><br />In order to
            explore some potential different feature combinations and their
            effects on the social dynamics of the experience, we had a few
            variations in logistics across each date: single pair blind date,
            group blind date, and friend blind date. <br /><br />From these
            three trials, we found that having dates planned for users generally
            enhanced their overall experience as it reduced decision fatigue and
            piqued excitement due to the blind nature. When moving to translate
            these insights into our final sociotechnical system, we felt we
            would run into significant problems trying to establish trust
            between online significant problems trying to establish trust
            between online daters choosing blind dates in a traditional dating
            app architecture.<br /><br />
            In thinking more about what made our friends trust the dates we were
            setting them up on in the piggyback prototype, we realized that it
            was the fact that we, as friends, had set them up and "vouched" for
            the person they were meeting. This is how Vouch was born. Rather
            than relying solely on individual swiping, Vouch places the power of
            matchmaking in the hands of your social circle. Once enough of your
            friends and your matches' friends have approved the match, you will
            be prompted with a Google form to input your availability, and a
            blind date will be set up for you.
          </p>
          <h4>Design and Implementation:</h4>
          <p>
            Without the time to create the perfect interface design, we focused
            on creating a simple and intuitive experience that emphasized social
            matchmaking. We streamlined onboarding to avoid overwhelming users,
            allowing them to quickly join and explore before building out their
            profiles in more detail. Users could sign up as daters, matchmakers,
            or both, and were guided through selecting preferences such as
            gender and sexuality. <br /><br />Once onboarded, matchmakers could
            swipe through candidates for their friends, locking in a friend to
            swipe for and voting on potential matches. We built in customization
            features for daters, like choosing preferred date activities and
            availability, which helped users coordinate matches and suggest
            compatible plans.

          <p>
            We developed the app using React Native with a backend powered by
            Google Firebase. This allowed us to authenticate users, store
            profiles, and calculate matches efficiently. Initially, we aimed to
            launch via TestFlight, but due to technical limitations, we pivoted
            to deploying a web-based version on Vercel. Despite this constraint,
            we successfully launched the app within the Stanford community,
            targeting friend groups as atomic networks to drive engagement and
            social accountability. While the web format may have impacted
            long-term retention, the technical foundation supported core
            functionality and enabled us to observe authentic user behavior.
            Features like the liaison role for coordinating dates and Google
            Form integration for availability were simple yet effective ways to
            facilitate real-life meetups through the app.
          </p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            Our launch successfully validated many of our core hypotheses about
            social matchmaking. After a week of use, we interviewed participants
            of different user types in order to gather their experiences into
            reflections on the design, user behavior, and social computing
            theory. We found that friend groups drove the most engagement and
            accountability on the platform. Users who joined with friends were
            significantly more active, regularly swiping and coordinating dates,
            and over only one week of use, we even observed a successful match
            that led to an in-person date. Our users found that the vouch
            process reduced the stress of self-presentation when meeting people;
            essentially, the difficulty of "making the first move".<br /><br />
            However, the launch also revealed important challenges. Solo users
            struggled to stay engaged without a built-in network, and
            matchmakers expressed hesitancy when swiping for friends due to a
            fear of disappointment from the dater. Additionally, users were
            reluctant to add acquaintances as friends without clear norms on who
            you should be able to swipe for, and wanted more in-app
            communication features to collaborate during the vouching process.
            These insights highlighted the need for stronger onboarding, clearer
            expectations/norms, and more robust tools for social coordination.
            Moving forward, future iterations should address the introduced
            complexities around pressure, accountability, and trust.
